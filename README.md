In this project, I integrated data from diverse sources, including CSV files and O*NET databases, to explore the intricate relationship between job descriptions and the technological skills currently in demand. Leveraging advanced tools such as DataFrames, RDD, and SQL within the Databricks environment, I conducted comprehensive data analysis and processing. Through comprehensive skill analysis and comparison, I discovered evident patterns and connections, providing insight into the changing environment of employment skill trends. Finally, I turned my research findings into presentations that effectively communicated insights regarding the dynamic interaction between job descriptions and the technical skills landscape.
